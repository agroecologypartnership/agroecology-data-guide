# Collect and send the metadata

Metadata are *data about data*. They provide the essential context that allows us to understand, locate, and reuse a dataset or research output. Without metadata, information can easily become unusable or forgotten. With metadata, we ensure that each data asset is described clearly, remains findable, and can be connected to the broader research landscape.

In our partnership, collecting and submitting metadata is a collective responsibility. Whenever you identify a research output, you should first inform your **task leader**. The task leader then notifies the data team at **agroecology-data\@lifewatch.eu**, while copying the Work Package lead. This way, every new output is tracked from the beginning.

The task leader is also responsible for collecting the metadata fields listed in Annex I of the DMP and included here below in the Table 1 for convenience. There are two ways to provide them:

-   By filling in the Excel metadata form available on our [SharePoint](https://ilvo.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/AGROECOLOGY_Partnership2-WP5_DataMonitoring/Gedeelde%20documenten/WP5%20-%20Data%20and%20Monitoring%20AE%20Transition/PROJECT%20IMPLEMENTATION/T5.1/Data%20Management%20Plan/v2.0/Data%20Overview?csf=1&web=1&e=CyWVTX).
-   By sending the necessary information directly to the data management team, who can complete the form on your behalf.

Once the metadata are collected, the data team will work with you to identify the type of data, select an appropriate standard, and decide on a trusted repository where the asset should be published. This ensures that our outputs are stored securely, remain discoverable, and align with FAIR principles.

*Table 1. Metadata fields and definitions. They are largely based on the **DataCite schema**, which is an international standard for describing research data. Each field has a short definition and an example to help you fill it in correctly.*
