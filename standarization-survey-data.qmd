# Survey data

Typically, surveys are created using an online tool. The link to the questionnaire is later passed to the participants, and the responses are collected in the platform. This method is both convenient and more effective compared to surveys done via text documents or email. However, there are certain steps to follow to ensure that the survey design and the results are fully interoperable and they are properly preserved in the long term, when software changes or gets deprecated. We will propose the use of three common survey software: We recommend the use of KoboToolbox as the first choice, since it is compatible with the XLSForm format. Alternatively, LimeSurvey can also be used. EUSurveys can be used only if there is need to adhere to very specific EU requirements that the other platforms cannot meet, as it has no tools for exporting the survey in interoperable formats.

## XLSForm and KoboToolbox

We recommend to adopt the XLSForm format for survey authoring. This format allows to write from scratch a survey following certain standard rules. The advantage is that there is a large community that has adopted this format and many tools have been developed, not only to create surveys and deploy online automatically, but also to automate reports, analysis and more. The format propose the use of a spreadsheet such as MS Excel, OpenOffice calc or Google Sheets. Three sheets shall be created: the first one "survey" contains the questions and their type, including free text answers, multiple or single choice and many more.



*Table 1. Survey sheet. Note in the column "type", the text just after "select_one" and "select_multiple" are unique identifiers that are used in the next sheet "choices" to link the questions to the possible answers. the column "name" is a unique identifier of the question. "label" has the text of the question that is shown to participants. It is possible to write the labels in several languages (via suffix ":en" for English, ":fr" for French, etc) to tackle participants that speak different languages.*

| type | name | label::en |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| text | Q1_name | What is the name of the platform? |
| text | Q2_website | What is the website of the platform? |
| text | Q3_contact_name | Who is the primary contact for this survey? |
| text | Q4_contact_email | What is the email address of the primary contact? |
| select_one list_5_agroecology | Q5_agroecology | Is the platform designed for the Agroecology community? |
| select_multiple list_6_focus | Q6_focus | Which thematic areas best describe the focus or services of your platform? |



The second sheet is "choices", containing the possible answers of questions with single or multiple choices. They are linked through unique identifiers.



*Table 2. Choices sheet. The column "list_name" contains the unique identifier that was given in the column "type" of the survey sheet. The column "name" has unique identifiers. The column "label" has the text of the answer that is shown to participants .It is possible to write the labels in several languages (via suffix ":en" for English, ":fr" for French, etc) to tackle participants that speak different languages.*

| list_name | name | label::en |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| list_5_agroecology | yes | Yes |
| list_5_agroecology | no | No |
| list_6_focus | agroecological_practices | Agroecological practices |
| list_6_focus | data_and_monitoring_tools | Data and monitoring tools |
| list_6_focus | training_and_knowledge_exchange | Training and knowledge exchange |
| list_6_focus | policy_and_governance_support | Policy and governance support |
| list_6_focus | collaboration_and_stakeholder_engagement | Collaboration and stakeholder engagement |
| list_6_focus | other | Other |



Lastly, there is a "settings" sheet that allows to write metadata, rules and more.



*Table 3. Settings sheet. In this case, it only contains the name and version of the survey.*

| form_title                  | form_id                     | version |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| Agroecology Platform Survey | agroecology_platform_survey | v1.0    |


### Using KoboToolbox for survey design and deployment

[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org) is an online platform that supports the XLSForm standard and allows researchers to design, deploy, and manage surveys for free. It was originally created for humanitarian organizations but is now widely used in research and development contexts. KoboToolbox offers an intuitive web interface, enabling all users to create complex forms that include conditional logic, geolocation, multimedia inputs, and more.

While KoboToolbox offers optional paid features for large organizations or high data volumes, its free tier is sufficient for most research projects. The platform is open to collaboration with academic institutions and complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A [Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/gdpr.html) can be signed online to ensure full compliance with data protection requirements.

#### Steps to create and archive a survey using KoboToolbox

1. **Register** for a free account at [https://www.kobotoolbox.org](https://www.kobotoolbox.org).
2. **Design your survey** directly in the platform using the form builder, or import an existing XLSForm spreadsheet.
3. **Export the survey structure**:
   - Inside your project, go to **Form → (three dots in the top-right corner) → Download XLS**.  
   - This export follows the XLSForm standard.
4. **Export each sheet to `.csv`** for long-term archival.  
   This ensures maximum interoperability and readability across software and time.
5. **Deploy the survey** to collect responses by sharing the generated link with participants.
6. **Download the responses** at **Data → Downloads → CSV** once data collection is complete.
7. **Archive together** the survey design (XLSForm and CSV versions) and the responses (CSV).  

This workflow ensures the entire lifecycle of the survey—from authoring to data collection and preservation—follows open, well-documented standards that can be reused or audited in the future.

### Alternative tools

Other tools are compatible with the XLSForm standard. The most notable is [Open Data Kit (ODK)](https://getodk.org), an open-source software ecosystem that supports field data collection, including offline mobile apps.  
Although ODK is fully open-source, its cloud hosting service has costs. Researchers could deploy their own ODK instance if resources allow. However, given the free hosting provided by KoboToolbox (with limitations), this is the most practical option for most research groups.


### FAIRness and long-term preservation

The XLSForm format, being based on spreadsheet structures (`.xlsx` or `.csv`), guarantees long-term accessibility and interoperability. Even if the tools used today (such as KoboToolbox) were to become unavailable, the survey structure and data would remain readable and reusable. This makes XLSForm a strong choice for compliance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

To ensure full FAIRness:
- Always archive both the survey structure (`.xlsx` and `.csv`) and the responses (`.csv`).
- Store these files in an open data repository or institutional archive.
- Include a short README file documenting the purpose, date, authorship, and data collection context.

Regarding the survey structure and responses, we recommend using text-delimited files, such as csv, which are widely adopted in data science and research workflows. These files offer several advantages: they are machine-readable, open, and not tied to any proprietary software, ensuring that data remains accessible and understandable in the long term.

To promote consistency and interoperability, we propose the following specifications for csv files:

- Use semicolons `;` as column separators.
- Use double quotes `"` to delimit text strings.
- Use UTF-8 as the character encoding.

We avoid commas `,` as separators because they are often used in free-text responses and could disrupt the file structure. Similarly, we recommend restricting the use of semicolons `;` and double quotes `"` to their intended purposes only (as column separators and string delimiters, respectively). Whenever possible, configure the survey platform to block or escape these characters in user-provided text. If such restrictions are not feasible, respondents should be instructed not to use these characters when completing the survey.
